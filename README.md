# Bubble Chart Demo

This demo draws bubble chart for data from API call.

## Getting Started

It is based on React + Redux + Saga and uses the D3 charting library and Bootstrap.

### Prerequisites

To install and run the application Node (version >= 6) is needed.

### Installing

To install this demo please run:

```
npm install
```

Installation doesn't require any additional steps.

## Running

To run the demo please run:

```
npm start
```

Demo will automatically open *localhost:3000* where it is available after running.

## Additional information

Demo form inputs are initially filled with preferred values to fasten usage. After submitting the form, chart will be available below the form.

This demo is responsive. Chart will scale properly too. Chart bubbles have tooltips, available on mobile devices (activated on click).

React uses Redux + Saga to store data loaded from API.
